An interactive Excel dashboard was created by integrating multiple pivot tables and visualizations to analyze Vrinda Store’s sales performance for the year 2022.
The dashboard provides a consolidated view of sales trends, customer demographics, order status, top-performing states, sales channels, and product categories.
